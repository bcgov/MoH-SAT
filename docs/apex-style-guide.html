<h2 id="s1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>This document serves as the <strong>complete</strong> definition of coding standards for
source code in the Apex Programming Language. An Apex source file is described as being <em>in Apex Style</em> if and only if it adheres to the rules herein.</p>

<p>Like other programming style guides, the issues covered span not only aesthetic issues of
formatting, but other types of conventions or coding standards as well. However, this document
focuses primarily on the <strong>hard-and-fast rules</strong> that we follow universally, and
avoids giving <em>advice</em> that isn't clearly enforceable (whether by human or tool).
</p>



<h3 id="s1.1-terminology">1.1 Terminology notes</h3>

<p>In this document, unless otherwise clarified:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The term <em>class</em> is used inclusively to mean an "ordinary" class, enum class,
  or interface.</li>

  <li>The term <em>member</em> (of a class) is used inclusively to mean a nested class, field,
  method, <em>or constructor</em>; that is, all top-level contents of a class except initializers
  and comments.

  </li><li>The term <em>comment</em> always refers to <em>implementation</em> comments. We do not
  use the phrase "documentation comments", instead using the common term "ApexDoc."</li>
</ol>

<p>Other "terminology notes" will appear occasionally throughout the document.</p>

<h3 id="s1.2-guide-notes">1.2 Guide notes</h3>

<p>Example code in this document is <strong>non-normative</strong>. That is, while the examples
are in Apex Style, they may not illustrate the <em>only</em> stylish way to represent the
code. Optional formatting choices made in examples should not be enforced as rules.</p>


<h2 id="s2-source-file-basics">2 Source file basics</h2>

<h3 id="s2.1-file-name">2.1 File name</h3>

<p>The source file name consists of the case-sensitive name of the top-level class it contains
(of which there is <a href="#s3.4.1-one-top-level-class">exactly one</a>), plus the
<code>.cls</code> extension.</p>

<h3 id="s2.2-file-encoding">2.2 File encoding: UTF-8</h3>

<p>Source files are encoded in <strong>UTF-8</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="s2.3-special-characters">2.3 Special characters</h3>

<h4 id="s2.3.1-whitespace-characters">2.3.1 Whitespace characters</h4>

<p>Aside from the line terminator sequence, the <strong>ASCII horizontal space
character</strong> (<strong>0x20</strong>) is the only whitespace character that appears
anywhere in a source file. This implies that:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All other whitespace characters in string and character literals are escaped.</li>

  <li>Tab characters are <strong>not</strong> used for indentation.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="s2.3.2-special-escape-sequences">2.3.2 Special escape sequences</h4>

<p>For any character that has a
<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/characters.html">
  special escape sequence</a>
(<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\b</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\t</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\n</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\f</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\r</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\"</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\'</code> and
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\\</code>), that sequence
is used rather than the corresponding octal
(e.g.&#160;<code class="badcode">\012</code>) or Unicode
(e.g.&#160;<code class="badcode">\u000a</code>) escape.</p>

<h4 id="s2.3.3-non-ascii-characters">2.3.3 Non-ASCII characters</h4>

<p>For the remaining non-ASCII characters, either the actual Unicode character
(e.g.&#160;<code class="prettyprint lang-java">&#8734;</code>) or the equivalent Unicode escape
(e.g.&#160;<code class="prettyprint lang-java">\u221e</code>) is used. The choice depends only on
which makes the code <strong>easier to read and understand</strong>, although Unicode escapes
outside string literals and comments are strongly discouraged.</p>

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> In the Unicode escape case, and occasionally even when actual
Unicode characters are used, an explanatory comment can be very helpful.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Example</th>
    <th>Discussion</th>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">String unitAbbrev = "&#956;s";</code></td>
    <td>Best: perfectly clear even without a comment.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs"; // "&#956;s"</code></td>
    <td>Allowed, but there's no reason to do this.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs";
      // Greek letter mu, "s"</code></td>
    <td>Allowed, but awkward and prone to mistakes.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td><code class="badcode">String unitAbbrev = "\u03bcs";</code></td>
    <td>Poor: the reader has no idea what this is.</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
     <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">return '\ufeff' + content;
       // byte order mark</code></td>
     <td>Good: use escapes for non-printable characters, and comment if necessary.</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Never make your code less readable simply out of fear that
some programs might not handle non-ASCII characters properly. If that should happen, those
programs are <strong>broken</strong> and they must be <strong>fixed</strong>.</p>

<h4 id="s2.3.34-soql-strings">2.3.4 SOQL Quoted String Escape Sequences</h4>

<p>SOQL defines <a href="https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.soql_sosl.meta/soql_sosl/sforce_api_calls_soql_select_quotedstringescapes.htm">several escape sequences</a> 
  that are valid in queries so that you can include special characters in your queries.</p>

<a name="filestructure"></a>
<h2 id="s3-source-file-structure">3 Source file structure</h2>

<div>
<p>A source file consists of, <strong>in order</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Top-level ApexDoc comments</li>
  <li>Exactly one top-level class</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p><strong>No blank lines</strong> separate each section that is present.</p>

<h3 id="s3.1-copyright-statement">3.1 Top-level ApexDoc comments</h3>

<p>Each top-level <code>global</code> or <code>public</code> class starts with an 
  ApexDoc on the first line, containing a high level description of its purpose.</p>


<h3 id="s3.2-class-declaration">3.2 Class declaration</h3>

<a name="oneclassperfile"></a>
<h4 id="s3.2.1-one-top-level-class">3.2.1 Exactly one top-level class declaration</h4>

<p>Each top-level class resides in a source file of its own.</p>

<a name="s3.2.2-class-member-ordering"></a>
<h4 id="s3.2.2-ordering-class-contents">3.4.2 Ordering of class contents</h4>

<p>The order you choose for the members and initializers of your class can have a great effect on
learnability. However, there's no single correct recipe for how to do it; different classes may
order their contents in different ways.</p>

<p>What is important is that each class uses <strong><em>some</em> logical order</strong>, which its
maintainer could explain if asked. For example, new methods are not just habitually added to the end
of the class, as that would yield "chronological by date added" ordering, which is not a logical
ordering.</p>



<a name="overloads"></a>
<h5 id="s3.2.2.1-overloads-never-split">3.4.2.1 Overloads: never split</h5>

<p>When a class has multiple constructors, or multiple methods with the same name, these appear
sequentially, with no other code in between (not even private members).</p>

<h2 id="s4-formatting">4 Formatting</h2>

<p class="terminology"><strong>Terminology Note:</strong> <em>block-like construct</em> refers to
the body of a class, method or constructor. Note that, by Section 4.8.3.1 on
<a href="#s4.8.3.1-array-initializers">array initializers</a>, any array initializer
<em>may</em> optionally be treated as if it were a block-like construct.</p>

<a name="braces"></a>
<h3 id="s4.1-braces">4.1 Braces</h3>

<h4 id="s4.1.1-braces-always-used">4.1.1 Braces are used where optional</h4>

<p>Braces are used with
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">if</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">else</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">for</code>,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">do</code> and
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">while</code> statements, even when the
body is empty or contains only a single statement.</p>

<h4 id="s4.1.2-blocks-k-r-style">4.1.2 Nonempty blocks: K &amp; R style</h4>

<p>Braces follow the Kernighan and Ritchie style
("<a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2012/07/new-programming-jargon.html">Egyptian brackets</a>")
for <em>nonempty</em> blocks and block-like constructs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No line break before the opening brace.</li>

  <li>Line break after the opening brace.</li>

  <li>Line break before the closing brace.</li>

  <li>Line break after the closing brace, <em>only if</em> that brace terminates a statement or
  terminates the body of a method, constructor, or <em>named</em> class.
  For example, there is <em>no</em> line break after the brace if it is followed by
  <code class="prettyprint lang-java">else</code> or a comma.</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
public void method() {
  if (condition()) {
    try {
      something();
    } catch (ProblemException e) {
      recover();
    }
  } else if (otherCondition()) {
    somethingElse();
  } else {
    lastThing();
  }
}
</pre>

<p>A few exceptions for enum classes are given in Section 4.8.1,
<a href="#s4.8.1-enum-classes">Enum classes</a>.</p>

<a name="emptyblocks"></a>
<h4 id="s4.1.3-braces-empty-blocks">4.1.3 Empty blocks: may be concise</h4>

<p>An empty block or block-like construct may be in K &amp; R style (as described in
<a href="#s4.1.2-blocks-k-r-style">Section 4.1.2</a>). Alternatively, it may be closed immediately
after it is opened, with no characters or line break in between
(<code class="prettyprint lang-java">{}</code>), <strong>unless</strong> it is part of a
<em>multi-block statement</em> (one that directly contains multiple blocks:
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">if/else</code> or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">try/catch/finally</code>).</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">  // This is acceptable
  void doNothing() {}

  // This is equally acceptable
  void doNothingElse() {
  }
</pre>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-java badcode">  // This is not acceptable: No concise empty blocks in a multi-block statement
  try {
    doSomething();
  } catch (Exception e) {}
</pre>

<h3 id="s4.2-block-indentation">4.2 Block indentation: +2 spaces</h3>

<p>Each time a new block or block-like construct is opened, the indent increases by two
spaces. When the block ends, the indent returns to the previous indent level. The indent level
applies to both code and comments throughout the block. (See the example in Section 4.1.2,
<a href="#s4.1.2-blocks-k-r-style">Nonempty blocks: K &amp; R Style</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="s4.3-one-statement-per-line">4.3 One statement per line</h3>

<p>Each statement is followed by a line break.</p>

<a name="columnlimit"></a>
<h3 id="s4.4-column-limit">4.4 Column limit: 100</h3>

<p>Apex code has a column limit of 100 characters. A "character" means any Unicode code point.
Except as noted below, any line that would exceed this limit must be line-wrapped, as explained in
Section 4.5, <a href="#s4.5-line-wrapping">Line-wrapping</a>.
</p>

<p class="tip">Each Unicode code point counts as one character, even if its display width is
greater or less. For example, if using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halfwidth_and_fullwidth_forms">fullwidth characters</a>,
you may choose to wrap the line earlier than where this rule strictly requires.</p>

<p><strong>Exceptions:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Lines where obeying the column limit is not possible (for example, a long URL in ApexDoc).</li>
  <li>Command lines in a comment that may be cut-and-pasted into a shell.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="s4.5-line-wrapping">4.5 Line-wrapping</h3>

<p class="terminology"><strong>Terminology Note:</strong> When code that might otherwise legally
occupy a single line is divided into multiple lines, this activity is called
<em>line-wrapping</em>.</p>

<p>There is no comprehensive, deterministic formula showing <em>exactly</em> how to line-wrap in
every situation. Very often there are several valid ways to line-wrap the same piece of code.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> While the typical reason for line-wrapping is to avoid
overflowing the column limit, even code that would in fact fit within the column limit <em>may</em>
be line-wrapped at the author's discretion.</p>

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Extracting a method or local variable may solve the problem
without the need to line-wrap.</p>

<h4 id="s4.5.1-line-wrapping-where-to-break">4.5.1 Where to break</h4>

<p>The prime directive of line-wrapping is: prefer to break at a
<strong>higher syntactic level</strong>. Also:</p>

<ol>
  <li>When a line is broken at a <em>non-assignment</em> operator the break comes <em>before</em>
  the symbol. (Note that this is not the same practice used in Apex style for other languages,
  such as C++ and JavaScript.)
    <ul>
      <li>This also applies to the following "operator-like" symbols:
        <ul>
          <li>the dot separator (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">.</code>)</li>
          <li>the two colons of a method reference
          (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">::</code>)</li>
          <li>an ampersand in a type bound
          (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">&lt;T extends Foo &amp; Bar&gt;</code>)</li>
          <li>a pipe in a catch block
          (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">catch (FooException | BarException e)</code>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>When a line is broken at an <em>assignment</em> operator the break typically comes
  <em>after</em> the symbol, but either way is acceptable.
    <ul>
      <li>This also applies to the "assignment-operator-like" colon in an enhanced
      <code class="prettyprint lang-java">for</code> ("foreach") statement.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>A method or constructor name stays attached to the open parenthesis
  (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">(</code>) that follows it.</li>

  <li>A comma (<code class="prettyprint lang-sql">,</code>) stays attached to the token that
  precedes it.</li>

  <li>Optionally, before reserved keywords in SOQL or SOSL statements.<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">
List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = [SELECT Id, Name from Account WHERE CreatedDate = :last_week];

List&lt;Account&gt; accounts = [
    SELECT
        Id, Name
    FROM Account
    WHERE CreatedDate = :this_week
    AND Id IN (
        SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity where CreatedDate = :this_week
    )
    ORDER BY CreatedDate DESC
];</pre>
  </li>
</ol>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The primary goal for line wrapping is to have clear
code, <em>not necessarily</em> code that fits in the smallest number of lines.</p>

<a name="indentation"></a>
<h4 id="s4.5.2-line-wrapping-indent">4.5.2 Indent continuation lines at least +4 spaces</h4>

<p>When line-wrapping, each line after the first (each <em>continuation line</em>) is indented
at least +4 from the original line.</p>

<p>When there are multiple continuation lines, indentation may be varied beyond +4 as
desired. In general, two continuation lines use the same indentation level if and only if they
begin with syntactically parallel elements.</p>

<p>Section 4.6.3 on <a href="#s4.6.3-horizontal-alignment">Horizontal alignment</a> addresses
the discouraged practice of using a variable number of spaces to align certain tokens with
previous lines.</p>

<h3 id="s4.6-whitespace">4.6 Whitespace</h3>

<h4 id="s4.6.1-vertical-whitespace">4.6.1 Vertical Whitespace</h4>

<p>A single blank line always appears:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Between</em> consecutive members or initializers of a class: fields, constructors,
  methods, nested classes, static initializers, and instance initializers.
  <ul>
    <li><span class="exception"><strong>Exception:</strong> A blank line between two consecutive
    fields (having no other code between them) is optional. Such blank lines are used as needed to
    create <em>logical groupings</em> of fields.</span></li>
    <li><span class="exception"><strong>Exception:</strong> Blank lines between enum constants are
    covered in <a href="#s4.8.1-enum-classes">Section 4.8.1</a>.</span></li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>As required by other sections of this document (such as Section 3,
  <a href="#s3-source-file-structure">Source file structure</a>, and Section 3.3,
  <a href="#s3.3-import-statements">Import statements</a>).</li>
</ol>

<p>A single blank line may also appear anywhere it improves readability, for example between
statements to organize the code into logical subsections. A blank line before the first member or
initializer, or after the last member or initializer of the class, is neither encouraged nor
discouraged.

</p><p><em>Multiple</em> consecutive blank lines are permitted, but never required (or encouraged).</p>

<h4 id="s4.6.2-horizontal-whitespace">4.6.2 Horizontal whitespace</h4>

<p>Beyond where required by the language or other style rules, and apart from literals, comments and
Apexdoc, a single ASCII space also appears in the following places <strong>only</strong>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Separating any reserved word, such as
  <code class="prettyprint lang-java">if</code>,
  <code class="prettyprint lang-java">for</code> or
  <code class="prettyprint lang-java">catch</code>, from an open parenthesis
  (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">(</code>)
  that follows it on that line</li>

  <li>Separating any reserved word, such as
  <code class="prettyprint lang-java">else</code> or
  <code class="prettyprint lang-java">catch</code>, from a closing curly brace
  (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">}</code>) that precedes it on that line</li>

  <li>On both sides of any binary or ternary operator. This also applies to the following
  "operator-like" symbols:
  <ul>
    <li>the colon (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">:</code>) in an enhanced
    <code class="prettyprint lang-java">for</code> statement</li>
  </ul>
    but not
  <ul>
    <li>the dot separator (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">.</code>), which is written like
    <code class="prettyprint lang-java">object.toString()</code></li>
    <li>the colon (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">:</code>) preceding a variable binds in SOQL or SOSL statements, which is written like
    <code class="prettyprint lang-java">B = [SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Id = :A.Id];</code></li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>On both sides of the double slash (<code class="prettyprint lang-java">//</code>) that
  begins an end-of-line comment. Here, multiple spaces are allowed, but not required.</li>

  <li>Between the type and variable of a declaration:
  <code class="prettyprint lang-java">List&lt;String&gt; list</code></li>

  <li><em>Optional</em> just inside both braces of an array initializer
  <ul>
    <li><code class="prettyprint lang-java">new Integer[] {5, 6}</code> and
    <code class="prettyprint lang-java">new Integer[] { 5, 6 }</code> are both valid</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This rule is never interpreted as requiring or forbidding additional space at the start or
end of a line; it addresses only <em>interior</em> space.</p>

<h4 id="s4.6.3-horizontal-alignment">4.6.3 Horizontal alignment: never required</h4>

<p class="terminology"><strong>Terminology Note:</strong> <em>Horizontal alignment</em> is the
practice of adding a variable number of additional spaces in your code with the goal of making
certain tokens appear directly below certain other tokens on previous lines.</p>

<p>This practice is permitted, but is <strong>never required</strong> by Apex Style. It is not
even required to <em>maintain</em> horizontal alignment in places where it was already used.</p>

<p>Here is an example without alignment, then using alignment:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">private Integer x; // this is fine
private AbstractTriggerFactory factory; // this too

private Integer                x; // permitted, but future edits
private AbstractTriggerFactory factory; // may leave it unaligned
</pre>

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> Alignment can aid readability, but it creates problems for
future maintenance.  Consider a future change that needs to touch just one line. This change may
leave the formerly-pleasing formatting mangled, and that is <strong>allowed</strong>. More often
it prompts the coder (perhaps you) to adjust whitespace on nearby lines as well, possibly
triggering a cascading series of reformattings. That one-line change now has a "blast radius."
This can at worst result in pointless busywork, but at best it still corrupts version history
information, slows down reviewers and exacerbates merge conflicts.</p>

<a name="parentheses"></a>
<h3 id="s4.7-grouping-parentheses">4.7 Grouping parentheses: recommended</h3>

<p>Optional grouping parentheses are omitted only when author and reviewer agree that there is no
reasonable chance the code will be misinterpreted without them, nor would they have made the code
easier to read. It is <em>not</em> reasonable to assume that every reader has the entire Apex
operator precedence table memorized.</p>

<h3 id="s4.8-specific-constructs">4.8 Specific constructs</h3>

<h4 id="s4.8.1-enum-classes">4.8.1 Enum classes</h4>

<p>After each comma that follows an enum constant, a line break is optional. Additional blank
lines (usually just one) are also allowed. This is one possibility:

</p><pre class="prettyprint lang-java">private enum Answer {
  YES,

  NO,
  MAYBE
}
</pre>

<p>An enum class with no methods and no documentation on its constants may optionally be formatted
as if it were an array initializer (see Section 4.8.3.1 on
<a href="#s4.8.3.1-array-initializers">array initializers</a>).</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">private enum Suit { CLUBS, HEARTS, SPADES, DIAMONDS }
</pre>

<p>Since enum classes <em>are classes</em>, all other rules for formatting classes apply.</p>

<a name="localvariables"></a>
<h4 id="s4.8.2-variable-declarations">4.8.2 Variable declarations</h4>

<h5 id="s4.8.2.1-variables-per-declaration">4.8.2.1 One variable per declaration</h5>

<p>Every variable declaration (field or local) declares only one variable.</p>

<p><strong>Exception:</strong> Multiple variable declarations are acceptable in the header of a
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">for</code> loop.</p>

<h5 id="s4.8.2.2-variables-limited-scope">4.8.2.2 Declared when needed</h5>

<p>Local variables are <strong>not</strong> habitually declared at the start of their containing
block or block-like construct. Instead, local variables are declared close to the point they are
first used (within reason), to minimize their scope. Local variable declarations typically have
initializers, or are initialized immediately after declaration.</p>

<h4 id="s4.8.3-arrays">4.8.3 Arrays</h4>

<h5 id="s4.8.3.1-array-initializers">4.8.3.1 Array initializers: can be "block-like"</h5>

<p>Any array initializer may <em>optionally</em> be formatted as if it were a "block-like
construct." For example, the following are all valid (<strong>not</strong> an exhaustive
list):</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">List&lt;String&gt; example = new List&lt;String&gt; {
    'one', 'two', 'three'
};

List&lt;String&gt; example = new List&lt;String&gt; {
    'one',
    'two',
    'three'
};
</pre>


<h4 id="s4.8.4-switch">4.8.4 Switch statements</h4>

<p class="terminology"><strong>Terminology Note:</strong> Inside the braces of a
<em>switch block</em> are one or more <em>statement groups</em>. Each statement group consists of
one or more <em>switch labels</em> (either <code class="prettyprint lang-java">when FOO</code> or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">when else</code>), followed by one or more statements.</p>

<h5 id="s4.8.4.1-switch-indentation">4.8.4.1 Indentation</h5>

<p>As with any other block, the contents of a switch block are indented +2.</p>

<p>After a switch label, there is a line break, and the indentation level is increased +2, exactly
as if a block were being opened. The following switch label returns to the previous indentation
level, as if a block had been closed.</p>

<h5 id="s4.8.4.2-switch-default">4.8.4.2 The <code>default</code> case is present</h5>

<p>Each switch statement includes the default <code class="prettyprint lang-java">when else</code> statement
group, even if it contains no code.</p>

</p>

<a name="annotations"></a>
<h4 id="s4.8.5-annotations">4.8.5 Annotations</h4>

<p>Annotations applying to a class, method or constructor appear immediately after the
documentation block, and each annotation is listed on a line of its own (that is, one annotation
per line). These line breaks do not constitute line-wrapping (Section
4.5, <a href="#s4.5-line-wrapping">Line-wrapping</a>), so the indentation level is not
increased. Example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">@AuraEnabled
public String getNameIfPresent() { ... }
</pre>

<p class="exception"><strong>Exception:</strong> A <em>single</em> parameterless annotation
<em>may</em> instead appear together with the first line of the signature, for example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">@isTest static void test_user_access() { ... }
</pre>

<p>Annotations applying to a field also appear immediately after the documentation block,
for example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">@AuraEnabled public String nameValue;
</pre>

<p>There are no specific rules for formatting annotations on parameters, local variables, or types.
</p>

<a name="comments"></a>
<h4 id="s4.8.6-comments">4.8.6 Comments</h4>

<p>This section addresses <em>implementation comments</em>. Apexdoc is addressed separately in
Section 7, <a href="#s7-apexdoc">Apexdoc</a>.</p>

<p>Any line break may be preceded by arbitrary whitespace followed by an implementation comment.
Such a comment renders the line non-blank.</p>

<h5 id="s4.8.6.1-block-comment-style">4.8.6.1 Block comment style</h5>

<p>Block comments are indented at the same level as the surrounding code. They may be in
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">/* ... */</code> style or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">// ...</code> style. For multi-line
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">/* ... */</code> comments, subsequent lines must start with
<code>*</code> aligned with the <code>*</code> on the previous line.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">/*
 * This is          // And so           /* Or you can
 * okay.            // is this.          * even do this. */
 */
</pre>


<p>Comments are not enclosed in boxes drawn with asterisks or other characters.</p>

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> When writing multi-line comments, use the
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">/* ... */</code> style if you want automatic code formatters to
re-wrap the lines when necessary (paragraph-style). Most formatters don't re-wrap lines in
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">// ...</code> style comment blocks.</p>

 

<a name="modifiers"></a>
<h4 id="s4.8.7-modifiers">4.8.7 Modifiers</h4>

<p>Class and member modifiers, when present, appear in the order
recommended by the Apex Language Specification:
</p>

<pre>private | public | global [virtual | abstract | with sharing | without sharing]</pre>

<h4 id="s4.8.8-numeric-literals">4.8.8 Numeric Literals</h4>

<p><code>long</code>-valued integer literals use an uppercase <code>L</code> suffix, never
lowercase (to avoid confusion with the digit <code>1</code>). For example, <code>3000000000L</code>
rather than <code class="badcode">3000000000l</code>.</p>

<a name="naming"></a>
<h2 id="s5-naming">5 Naming</h2>

<h3 id="s5.1-identifier-names">5.1 Rules common to all identifiers</h3>

<p>Identifiers use only ASCII letters and digits, and, in a small number of cases noted below,
underscores. Thus each valid identifier name is matched by the regular expression
<code>\w+</code> .</p>

<p>In Apex Style, special prefixes or suffixes are <strong>not</strong> used. For example, these
names are not Apex Style: <code class="badcode">name_</code>, <code class="badcode">mName</code>,
<code class="badcode">s_name</code> and <code class="badcode">kName</code>.</p>

<h3 id="s5.2-specific-identifier-names">5.2 Rules by identifier type</h3>

<h4 id="s5.2.1-class-names">5.2.1 Class names</h4>

<p>Class names are written in <a href="#s5.3-camel-case">UpperCamelCase</a>.</p>

<p>Class names are typically nouns or noun phrases. For example,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">Character</code> or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">ImmutableList</code>. Interface names may also be nouns or
noun phrases (for example, <code class="prettyprint lang-java">List</code>), but may sometimes be
adjectives or adjective phrases instead (for example,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">Readable</code>).</p>

<p>There are no specific rules or even well-established conventions for naming annotation types.</p>

<p><em>Test</em> classes are named starting with the name of the class they are testing, and ending
with <code class="prettyprint lang-java">Test</code>. For example,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">HashTest</code> or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">HashIntegrationTest</code>.</p>

<h4 id="s5.2.2-method-names">5.2.2 Method names</h4>

<p>Method names are written in <a href="#s5.3-camel-case">lowerCamelCase</a>.</p>

<p>Method names are typically verbs or verb phrases. For example,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">sendMessage</code> or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">stop</code>.</p>

<p>Underscores may appear in Apex <em>test</em> method names to separate logical components of the
name, with <em>each</em> component written in <a href="#s5.3-camel-case">lowerCamelCase</a>.
One typical pattern is <code><i>&lt;methodUnderTest&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;state&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;expectation&gt;</i></code>,
for example <code class="prettyprint lang-java">save_accountName_throw_exception</code>. There is no One Correct
Way to name test methods.</p>

<a name="constants"></a>
<h4 id="s5.2.3-constant-names">5.2.3 Constant names</h4>

<p>Constant names use <code class="prettyprint lang-java">CONSTANT_CASE</code>: all uppercase
letters, with each word separated from the next by a single underscore. But what <em>is</em> a
constant, exactly?</p>

<p>Constants are static final fields whose contents are deeply immutable and whose methods have no
detectable side effects. This includes primitives, Strings, immutable types, and immutable
collections of immutable types. If any of the instance's observable state can change, it is not a
constant. Merely <em>intending</em> to never mutate the object is not enough. Examples:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">// Constants
public static final Integer NUMBER = 5;
public static final List&lt;String&gt; NAMES = List.of("Ed", "Ann");
public static final Map&lt;String, Integer&gt; AGES = newMap&lt;String, Integer&gt;{ "Ed" =>35, "Ann" => 32 };
public enum SomeEnum { ENUM_CONSTANT }

// Not constants
private static String nonFinal = "non-final";
private final String nonStatic = "non-static";
private static final Set&lt;String&gt; mutableCollection = new Set&lt;String&gt;();
</pre>

<p>These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.</p>

<h4 id="s5.2.4-non-constant-field-names">5.2.4 Non-constant field names</h4>

<p>Non-constant field names (static or otherwise) are written
in <a href="#s5.3-camel-case">lowerCamelCase</a>.</p>

<p>These names are typically nouns or noun phrases.  For example,
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">computedValues</code> or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">index</code>.</p>

<h4 id="s5.2.5-parameter-names">5.2.5 Parameter names</h4>

<p>Parameter names are written in <a href="#s5.3-camel-case">lowerCamelCase</a>.</p>

<p>One-character parameter names in public methods should be avoided.</p>

<h4 id="s5.2.6-local-variable-names">5.2.6 Local variable names</h4>

<p>Local variable names are written in <a href="#s5.3-camel-case">lowerCamelCase</a>.</p>

<p>Even when final and immutable, local variables are not considered to be constants, and should not
be styled as constants.</p>

<a name="acronyms"></a>
<a name="camelcase"></a>
<h3 id="s5.3-camel-case">5.3 Camel case: defined</h3>

<p>Sometimes there is more than one reasonable way to convert an English phrase into camel case,
such as when acronyms or unusual constructs like "IPv6" or "iOS" are present. To improve
predictability, Apex Style specifies the following (nearly) deterministic scheme.</p>

<p>Beginning with the prose form of the name:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Convert the phrase to plain ASCII and remove any apostrophes. For example, "M&#252;ller's
  algorithm" might become "Muellers algorithm".</li>

  <li>Divide this result into words, splitting on spaces and any remaining punctuation (typically
  hyphens).

  <ul>
    <li><em>Recommended:</em> if any word already has a conventional camel-case appearance in common
    usage, split this into its constituent parts (e.g., "AdWords" becomes "ad&#160;words"). Note
    that a word such as "iOS" is not really in camel case <em>per se</em>; it defies <em>any</em>
    convention, so this recommendation does not apply.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Now lowercase <em>everything</em> (including acronyms), then uppercase only the first
  character of:
  <ul>
    <li>... each word, to yield <em>upper camel case</em>, or</li>
    <li>... each word except the first, to yield <em>lower camel case</em></li>
  </ul>
  </li>

  <li>Finally, join all the words into a single identifier.</li>
</ol>

<p>Note that the casing of the original words is almost entirely disregarded. Examples:</p>

<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Prose form</th>
    <th>Correct</th>
    <th>Incorrect</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"XML HTTP request"</td>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">XmlHttpRequest</code></td>
    <td><code class="badcode">XMLHTTPRequest</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"new customer ID"</td>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">newCustomerId</code></td>
    <td><code class="badcode">newCustomerID</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"inner stopwatch"</td>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">innerStopwatch</code></td>
    <td><code class="badcode">innerStopWatch</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"supports IPv6 on iOS?"</td>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">supportsIpv6OnIos</code></td>
    <td><code class="badcode">supportsIPv6OnIOS</code></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"YouTube importer"</td>
    <td><code class="prettyprint lang-java">YouTubeImporter</code><br>
        <code class="prettyprint lang-java">YoutubeImporter</code>*</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>*Acceptable, but not recommended.</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Some words are ambiguously hyphenated in the English
language: for example "nonempty" and "non-empty" are both correct, so the method names
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">checkNonempty</code> and
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">checkNonEmpty</code> are likewise both correct.</p>

<h3 id="s6.1-caught-exceptions">6.1 Caught exceptions: not ignored</h3>

<p>Except as noted below, it is very rarely correct to do nothing in response to a caught
exception. (Typical responses are to log it, or if it is considered "impossible", rethrow it as an
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">AssertionError</code>.)</p>

<p>When it truly is appropriate to take no action whatsoever in a catch block, the reason this is
justified is explained in a comment.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">try {
  int i = Integer.parseInt(response);
  return handleNumericResponse(i);
} catch (NumberFormatException ok) {
  // it's not numeric; that's fine, just continue
}
return handleTextResponse(response);
</pre>

<p class="exception"><strong>Exception:</strong> In tests, a caught exception may be ignored
without comment <em>if</em> its name is or begins with <code class="prettyprint lang-java">expected</code>. The
following is a very common idiom for ensuring that the code under test <em>does</em> throw an
exception of the expected type, so a comment is unnecessary here.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">try {
  emptyStack.pop();
  fail();
} catch (NoSuchElementException expected) {
}
</pre>

<h3 id="s6.2-static-members">6.2 Static members: qualified using class</h3>

<p>When a reference to a static class member must be qualified, it is qualified with that class's
name, not with a reference or expression of that class's type.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">Foo aFoo = ...;
Foo.aStaticMethod(); // good
<span class="badcode">aFoo.aStaticMethod();</span> // bad
<span class="badcode">somethingThatYieldsAFoo().aStaticMethod();</span> // very bad
</pre>

<a name="apexdoc"></a>
<h2 id="s7-apexdoc">7 ApexDoc</h2>



<h3 id="s7.1-apexdoc-formatting">7.1 Formatting</h3>

<h4 id="s7.1.1-apexdoc-multi-line">7.1.1 General form</h4>

<p>The <em>basic</em> formatting of Apexdoc blocks is as seen in this example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">/**
 * Multiple lines of Apexdoc text are written here,
 * wrapped normally...
 */
public Integer method(String p1) { ... }
</pre>

<p>... or in this single-line example:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-java">/** An especially short bit of Apexdoc. */
</pre>

<p>The basic form is always acceptable. The single-line form may be substituted when the entirety
of the Apexdoc block (including comment markers) can fit on a single line. Note that this only
applies when there are no block tags such as <code>@return</code>.

<h3 id="s7.2-summary-fragment">7.2 The summary fragment</h3>

<p>Each Apexdoc block begins with a brief <strong>summary fragment</strong>. This
fragment is very important: it is the only part of the text that appears in certain contexts such as
class and method indexes.</p>

<p>This is a fragment&#8212;a noun phrase or verb phrase, not a complete sentence. It does
<strong>not</strong> begin with <code class="badcode">A {@code Foo} is a...</code>, or
<code class="badcode">This method returns...</code>, nor does it form a complete imperative sentence
like <code class="badcode">Save the record.</code>. However, the fragment is capitalized and
punctuated as if it were a complete sentence.</p>

<p class="tip"><strong>Tip:</strong> A common mistake is to write simple Apexdoc in the form
<code class="badcode">/** @return the customer ID */</code>. This is incorrect, and should be
changed to <code class="prettyprint lang-java">/** Returns the customer ID. */</code>.</p>

<a name="s7.3.3-apexdoc-optional"></a> 
<h3 id="s7.3-apexdoc-where-required">7.3 Where Apexdoc is used</h3>

<p>At the <em>minimum</em>, Apexdoc is present for every
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">public</code> class, and every
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">public</code> or
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">protected</code> member of such a class, with a few exceptions
noted below.</p>

<p>Additional Apexdoc content may also be present, as explained in Section 7.3.4,
<a href="#s7.3.4-apexdoc-non-required">Non-required Apexdoc</a>.</p>

<h4 id="s7.3.1-apexdoc-exception-self-explanatory">7.3.1 Exception: self-explanatory methods</h4>

<p>Apexdoc is optional for "simple, obvious" methods like
<code class="prettyprint lang-java">getFoo</code>, in cases where there <em>really and truly</em> is
nothing else worthwhile to say but "Returns the foo".</p>

<p class="note"><strong>Important:</strong> it is not appropriate to cite this exception to justify
omitting relevant information that a typical reader might need to know. For example, for a method
named <code class="prettyprint lang-java">getCanonicalName</code>, don't omit its documentation
(with the rationale that it would say only
<code class="badcode">/** Returns the canonical name. */</code>) if a typical reader may have no idea
what the term "canonical name" means!</p>

<h4 id="s7.3.2-apexdoc-exception-overrides">7.3.2 Exception: overrides</h4>

<p>Apexdoc is not always present on a method that overrides a supertype method.

</p>



<h4 id="s7.3.4-apexdoc-non-required">7.3.4 Non-required Apexdoc</h4>

<p>Other classes and members have Apexdoc <em>as needed or desired</em>.

</p><p>Whenever an implementation comment would be used to define the overall purpose or behavior of a
class or member, that comment is written as Apexdoc instead (using <code>/**</code>).</p>

<p>Non-required Apexdoc is not strictly required to follow the formatting rules of Sections
7.1.2, 7.1.3, and 7.2, though it is of course recommended.</p>
